This is a browser extension that changes the colors of the header and footer of the AWS management console to make it easier to distinguish between multiple environments. It has the following features
- AccountID and region support; even if you can't get the account ID from the menu due to AWS SSO.
- No communication, no libraries. Secure, as it only requires permission to save color settings.
- Open source.
